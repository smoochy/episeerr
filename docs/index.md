### How Features Work Together

**Episode Selection Workflow:**

```log
Request with episeerr_select tag â†’ Sonarr webhook â†’ Episode selection interface â†’ Manual choice
```

**Viewing Automation Workflow:**

```log
Watch episode â†’ Tautulli/Jellyfin webhook â†’ Apply rule â†’ Update episodes in Sonarr
```

**Storage Management Workflow:**

```log
Storage check â†’ Below threshold â†’ Cleanup based on grace/dormant timers â†’ Stop when above threshold
```

### Rule Protection System

- **Rules with grace/dormant timers:** Participate in storage cleanup
- **Rules with null timers:** Protected, never cleaned up
- **Global storage gate:** Only runs cleanup when needed, stops when threshold met
