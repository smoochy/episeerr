- **Dormant Check Path** (right): Storage-gated cleanup for inactive series  
- **Grace Period Logic**: Recycle bin system with individual episode timers
- **Request System** (bottom): Manual episode selection workflow
- **Dry Run Protection**: Prevents actual deletions during testing

### How Features Work Together

**Episode Selection Workflow:**
```
Request with episeerr_select tag → Sonarr webhook → Episode selection interface → Manual choice
```

**Viewing Automation Workflow:**
```
Watch episode → Tautulli/Jellyfin webhook → Apply rule → Update episodes in Sonarr
```

**Storage Management Workflow:**
```
Storage check → Below threshold → Cleanup based on grace/dormant timers → Stop when above threshold
```

### Rule Protection System
- **Rules with grace/dormant timers:** Participate in storage cleanup
- **Rules with null timers:** Protected, never cleaned up
- **Global storage gate:** Only runs cleanup when needed, stops when threshold met
