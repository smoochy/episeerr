## Core Concept

**Tags are temporary signals, not permanent labels.** They tell Episeerr to "hijack" the series for custom processing, then disappear.

**Auto-assign** lets Sonarr/Jellyseerr control initial downloads, then Episeerr manages going forward.

---

## Tag Behavior (Temporary Signals)

### episeerr_default Tag

**Purpose:** Hijack the series immediately and apply GET rule

**Lifecycle:**
```
1. Series added to Sonarr with episeerr_default tag
2. Sonarr webhook fires → Episeerr receives it
3. Episeerr processes immediately:
   - Adds series to default rule
   - Applies GET rule (monitors/searches X episodes)
   - Removes tag (processing complete)
4. Tag disappears from Sonarr (this is normal!)
```

**Result:** Episodes are already monitored/searched based on your GET rule

**Use case:** You want Episeerr to take control from the start

---

### episeerr_select Tag

**Purpose:** Hijack the series for manual episode selection

**Lifecycle:**
```
1. Series added to Sonarr with episeerr_select tag
2. Sonarr webhook fires → Episeerr receives it
3. Episeerr creates selection interface:
   - Unmonitors all episodes
   - Shows episode picker in Episeerr UI
   - Waits for your selection
4. You select episodes → Only those monitored
5. Tag removed after processing
```

**Result:** Only your hand-picked episodes are monitored

**Use case:** You want to choose specific episodes (pilots, finales, etc.)

---
## Tag Lifecycle and Drift Detection

**Tags are automatically managed by Episeerr.** You don't need to manually create or maintain them.

### How Tags Work

1. **When you create a rule** called "binge_watcher":
   - Episeerr creates `episeerr_binge_watcher` tag in Sonarr automatically
   - Tag is added to Sonarr's delay profile (if configured)

2. **When series is assigned to that rule**:
   - Episeerr applies `episeerr_binge_watcher` tag to the series in Sonarr
   - Tag indicates which rule manages this series

3. **If you manually change the tag in Sonarr**:
   - Episeerr detects the drift (on next watch, cleanup, or startup)
   - Automatically moves the series to the correct rule in config
   - Your manual tag change becomes the new source of truth

4. **When you delete a rule**:
   - Tag removed from all series
   - Tag removed from Sonarr entirely
   - Tag removed from delay profile

### Drift Detection

**Episeerr checks for tag mismatches in 4 places:**

1. **Watch webhooks** - When you watch an episode
2. **Cleanup cycles** - Every 6 hours (configurable)
3. **Startup** - When Episeerr starts
4. **Clean Config** - When you click the "Clean Config" button

**What gets detected:**
- ✅ Tag changed in Sonarr → Series moved to matching rule
- ✅ Tag removed in Sonarr → Tag re-added from config
- ✅ Tag added to unmanaged series → Series added to that rule

**Example:**
```
Series "Breaking Bad" is in "binge_watcher" rule
You manually change tag to "episeerr_weekly" in Sonarr
Next time Episeerr checks:
  → Detects drift
  → Moves "Breaking Bad" from "binge_watcher" to "weekly" rule
  → Series now managed by "weekly" rule
```

### Orphaned Tags

**What happens if you tag a series in Sonarr before adding it to Episeerr?**

Episeerr will detect it and add the series to the matching rule automatically:
```
1. You add series to Sonarr manually
2. You tag it with episeerr_binge_watcher in Sonarr
3. Episeerr detects orphaned tag (on startup/cleanup/clean_config)
4. Series automatically added to "binge_watcher" rule
```

This allows you to manage series assignment entirely through Sonarr tags if you prefer!

## Auto-Assign Setting (No Tag Required)

**Location:** Episeerr → Scheduler → Global Settings → "Auto-assign new series to default rule"

**Purpose:** Let Sonarr/Jellyseerr determine what to download initially, Episeerr manages cleanup/future episodes

**Lifecycle:**
```
1. Series added to Sonarr WITHOUT any tag
2. Sonarr/Jellyseerr monitors episodes as normal
3. Sonarr webhook fires → Episeerr receives it
4. Episeerr adds series to default rule silently
5. NO immediate processing - waits for you
6. When you watch first episode → Rule applies from there
```

**Result:** Sonarr controls initial downloads, Episeerr manages after first watch

**Use case:** 
- You request "Season 3 only" in Jellyseerr
- Let it download normally
- Episeerr manages cleanup and future episodes when you start watching

## When to Use Which

| Scenario | Method | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **New show, start from S1E1** | `episeerr_default` tag | GET rule applies immediately |
| **New show, start from specific season** | `episeerr_default` tag + Jellyseerr webhook | Starts from requested season, not S1E1 |
| **Let Sonarr/Jellyseerr decide initially** | Auto-assign (no tag) | Full control initially, Episeerr manages after first watch |
| **Only want specific episodes** | `episeerr_select` tag | Manual episode selection interface |
| **Don't want Episeerr at all** | No tag + auto-assign OFF | Normal Sonarr behavior |
| **Existing shows** | Manual assignment in Series Management | Add to rule whenever you want |

---

## Common Confusion

### "The tag disappeared, did it fail?"

**NO!** Tag disappearing = **success**. The tag is just a signal to hijack the series. Once processed, it's removed.

**How to verify it worked:**

1. **Check Episeerr** → Series Management
   - Series should be listed under default rule
   
2. **Check Sonarr**
   - First X episodes should be monitored
   - If action is "search", they should be searching
   
3. **Check logs** (`/app/logs/app.log`):
   ```
   ✓ Monitored X episodes for [series name]
   ✓ Started search for [series name]
   ```

If you see these, **it worked!** The tag did its job and was cleaned up.

---

### "I have both auto-tagging and auto-assign enabled"

**This is fine!** They don't conflict:

- **If auto-tagging succeeds:** Tag is added → Episeerr processes immediately → Tag removed
- **If auto-tagging fails:** No tag → Auto-assign catches it → Added to rule, waits for first watch

**Recommendation:** Choose one approach for simplicity:
- **Auto-tagging:** More immediate (episodes ready right away)
- **Auto-assign:** More flexible (let Sonarr/Jellyseerr control initial downloads)

---

### "Nothing is happening when I add a series"

**Check these in order:**

1. **Is Sonarr webhook configured?**
   - Sonarr → Settings → Connect → Webhook
   - URL: `http://your-episeerr:5002/sonarr-webhook`
   - Trigger: "On Series Add"

2. **Are you using tags or auto-assign?**
   - With tag: Check if tag exists in Sonarr Settings → Tags
   - Without tag: Check if auto-assign is enabled in Episeerr

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   grep "Processing.*with episeerr_default\|Auto-assigned" /app/logs/app.log | tail -20
   ```

4. **Verify default rule exists:**
   - Episeerr → Rules → Should have a rule marked as "Default"

## Complete Workflows

### Workflow 1: episeerr_default (Immediate Processing)

```
User Action:
├─ Add series to Sonarr with episeerr_default tag
│
Sonarr:
├─ Fires webhook to Episeerr
│
Episeerr:
├─ Receives webhook
├─ Detects episeerr_default tag
├─ Adds series to default rule
├─ Reads GET settings (e.g., "Get 3 episodes")
├─ Monitors S1E1, S1E2, S1E3 in Sonarr
├─ Searches for episodes (if action is "search")
├─ Removes episeerr_default tag
│
Result:
└─ Episodes ready immediately, tag gone ✅
```

**With Jellyseerr:**
```
User Action:
├─ Request Season 3 in Jellyseerr
│
Jellyseerr:
├─ Webhook to Episeerr (captures Season 3 request)
├─ Adds series to Sonarr with episeerr_default tag
│
Sonarr:
├─ Fires webhook to Episeerr
│
Episeerr:
├─ Receives webhook
├─ Remembers Season 3 from Jellyseerr webhook
├─ Adds series to default rule
├─ Applies GET rule starting from Season 3 (not Season 1!)
├─ Monitors S3E1, S3E2, S3E3 (if GET = 3 episodes)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Check | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Tag doesn't appear in Sonarr** | Auto-tagging enabled? Tag exists in Sonarr? | Create tag manually in Sonarr Settings → Tags |
| **Tag appears but nothing happens** | Sonarr webhook configured? | Add webhook: `http://episeerr:5002/sonarr-webhook` |
| **Episodes not monitored** | Default rule exists? GET settings configured? | Check Episeerr → Rules → Default rule |
| **Auto-assign not working** | Setting enabled? Sonarr webhook configured? | Enable in Scheduler → Global Settings |
| **Starting from wrong season** | Using Jellyseerr webhook? | Configure: `http://episeerr:5002/seerr-webhook` |

**Still stuck?** Check logs:
```bash
# See webhook processing
grep "Processing.*episeerr_default\|Auto-assigned" /app/logs/app.log

# See what episodes were monitored
grep "Monitored.*episodes for" /app/logs/app.log

# See any errors
grep "Error\|Failed" /app/logs/app.log | tail -20
```

**Key Takeaway:** Tags are temporary signals that trigger immediate processing, then disappear. Auto-assign adds series silently and waits for your first watch. Both are valid approaches depending on your workflow!
