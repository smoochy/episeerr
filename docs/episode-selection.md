# Episode Selection Guide

Episeerr's episode selection system allows you to choose exactly which episodes you want across multiple seasons, giving you surgical precision over your downloads.

## When to Use Episode Selection

Perfect for:
- **Pilot episodes:** Try new shows without committing to full seasons
- **Specific episodes:** Get episodes you missed or want to rewatch  
- **Limited storage:** Precise control over what gets downloaded
- **Catch-up viewing:** Get specific episodes to catch up on a series

## How Episode Selection Works

### Workflow Overview
1. **Request initiated** (via Sonarr, Jellyseerr, Overseerr ot other third party app using tag)
2. **Series added to Sonarr** with `episeerr_select` tag
3. **All episodes unmonitored** (prevents automatic downloads)
4. **Selection interface appears** in Episeerr pending requests
5. **User selects episodes** across any seasons
6. **Only selected episodes monitored** and searched
**Note, if requested on jellyseer or overseer with an episeerr tag then the request will be deleted from seer after it is processed. rhis is necessary to prevent seer app from readding it.

## Episode Selection Interface

### Season Selection
- Choose which seasons you want to work with
- Can select multiple seasons (e.g., Season 1 and 3)
- Seasons not selected won't appear in episode selection

### Episode Selection  
- Browse episodes with descriptions
- Select episodes across different seasons
- Visual indicators show:
  - Episode numbers and titles
  - Episode descriptions
  - Selection counts per season

### Selection Tools
- **Select All (Current Season):** Select all episodes in active season
- **Clear Current:** Deselect all episodes in active season  
- **Clear All:** Deselect all episodes across all seasons
- **Selection Summary:** Shows total episodes and breakdown by season

## Multi-Season Selection

### Example: Catching Up on "Lost"
Want to watch:
- Season 1: Episodes 1-3 (pilot + setup)
- Season 2: Episode 1 (season premiere)  
- Season 4: Episodes 12-14 (specific arc)

**Process:**
1. Select Seasons: 1, 2, 4
2. Season 1: Check episodes 1, 2, 3
3. Season 2: Check episode 1  
4. Season 4: Check episodes 12, 13, 14
5. Submit: Only these 6 episodes get monitored

### Benefits of Multi-Season Support
- **Precise control:** Get exactly what you want
- **Storage efficient:** No unwanted episodes
- **Flexible viewing:** Support non-linear viewing patterns
- **Custom collections:** Create your own "best of" collections

## Special Behaviors

### Pilot Episode Detection
If you select **only the first episode** of Season 1:
- `episeerr_select` tag is **removed**
- Series is **assigned to default rule**
- Treated as "pilot viewing" - normal automation takes over

### Multiple Episode Selection
If you select **multiple episodes** or **non-pilot episodes**:
- `episeerr_select` tag is **kept**
- **Only selected episodes** are monitored
- **No automatic rule assignment** (manual management)

## Integration with Rules System

### Episode Selection vs Rules
- **Episode Selection:** Manual, precise, one-time selection
- **Rules System:** Automatic, ongoing management based on viewing

### Combining Both Systems
1. **Use episode selection** for initial precise requests
2. **Switch to rules** for ongoing automation by removing `episeerr_select` tag
3. **Keep episode selection** for shows you want manual control over

## Managing Pending Requests

### Viewing Pending Requests
- Go to Episeerr → Pending Requests
- Shows all series awaiting episode selection
- Notification indicators alert you to new requests

### Request Actions
- **Select Seasons:** Choose which seasons to work with
