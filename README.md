# Episeerr

Smart episode management for Sonarr - Get episodes as you watch, clean up automatically when storage gets low.

**Perfect for:**
- Limited storage setups (seedboxes, VPS, budget home servers)
- Preventing runaway downloads that fill your disk
- Automated cleanup based on viewing activity
- Per-season tracking for shows with multiple active seasons
- Granular episode-level control
- Custom rules for different types of shows

This project started as scratching my own itch - I wanted more granular series management and couldn't find exactly what I wanted. I'm not a programmer by trade, but I had a clear vision for the solution I needed. I used AI as a development tool to help implement my ideas faster, just like any other tool. The creativity, problem-solving, architecture decisions, and feature design are all mine - AI helped with code, syntax and implementation details. Although I run everything in my own production environment first, it is catered to my environment and is use at your own risk. All code is open source for anyone to review and audit. The tool has been useful for me, and I shared it in case others can benefit from it too - but I absolutely understand if some prefer to stick with established solutions.

## What It Does

Episeerr automates your TV library with three independent features:

🎯 **[Episode Selection](./docs/features/episode-selection.md)** - Choose exactly which episodes you want  
⚡ **[Viewing Automation](./docs/features/viewing-automation.md)** - Next episode ready when you watch  
💾 **[Storage Management](./docs/features/storage-management.md)** - Automatic cleanup when storage gets low

**Use one, some, or all** - they work independently!

```yaml
services:
  episeerr:

      # Optional - For viewing automation
      - TAUTULLI_URL=http://your-tautulli:8181
      - TAUTULLI_API_KEY=your_tautulli_key
      # OR

## How It Works

### Smart Rules System

Create rules with intuitive dropdowns:

**GET:** What to prepare next (e.g., "3 episodes", "1 season", "all")  
**KEEP:** What to retain (e.g., "1 episode", "1 season", "all")  
**ACTION:** Monitor or search immediately

### Grace Periods (Time-Based Cleanup)

**Grace Watched:** Deletes OLD watched episodes after X days, keeps last watched as bookmark  
**Grace Unwatched:** Deletes unwatched episodes after X days, keeps first unwatched as bookmark  
**Dormant:** Deletes EVERYTHING after X days of no activity (abandoned shows)

### Storage Gate

- Set one global threshold: "Keep 20GB free"
- Cleanup only runs when below threshold
- Stops immediately when back above threshold

**Learn more:** [Deletion System Guide](./docs/core-concepts/deletion-system.md)

## Example Configuration

### Binge Watcher Rule

```yaml
Get: 3 episodes
Keep: 1 episode
Grace Watched: 7 days
Grace Unwatched: 14 days
Dormant: 30 days
```

**What happens:**

1. **Watch E10** → Next 3 episodes (E11-E13) monitored/searched
2. **Keep E10** → Delete E1-E9 (outside keep window)
3. **After 7 days inactive** → Delete E10 (grace expired, bookmark kept)
4. **After 30 days inactive** → Delete entire show (abandoned)
