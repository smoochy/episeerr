# Changelog

## [Unreleased / Dev]

### v3.3.4 - 2025-02-22
- **Always Have** — new rule parameter with expression syntax for episodes that should always be present and protected from cleanup
  - Expression examples: `s1` (full season), `s1e1` (pilot), `s1, s*e1` (showcase — season 1 + first ep of every other season), `s1-3` (season range)
  - Processes on rule assignment (new series or reassignment) — monitors and searches matching episodes
  - Protected from Grace and Keep cleanup; only Dormant overrides it
  - Works alongside Get/Keep/Grace independently
- **Series page selection** — list icon on every poster (grid) and table row launches the selection flow for any existing series; grab specific seasons/episodes or just change the rule without touching Sonarr tags
- **Plex integration** — watchlist sync, now-playing widget
  - TV shows added to Plex watchlist create a pending selection request
  - Movies go straight to Radarr
  - Optional movie cleanup: delete from Radarr after watched + grace period
  - Sync settings integrated into existing Plex Save button on Setup page
- **Plex/Spotify now-playing widgets** on dashboard
- **Rule picker on selection page** — dropdown pre-selects the show's current rule; Apply to reassign only (no processing), or pick episodes manually and still assign a rule for ongoing management
- **Plex token helper script** (`get_plex_token.py`)

### Fixes
- Rule reassignment now removes series from old rule before adding to new one
- Rule assignment is purely additive — never unmonitors or deletes existing episodes when reassigning
- Duplicate pending request check — reuses existing request if series already queued
- Cancel on selection page deletes the pending request before navigating back
- Stat pills unassigned count no longer goes negative when stale config entries exist for deleted series
- After selection flow, lands on Rules page instead of index
- Plex watchlist fetch includes `includeGuids=1` for TMDB/TVDB ID resolution
- Watchlist sync skips shows already in Episeerr config or with pending selection requests

---

## [2.9.8] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Auto-cleanup of deleted series**: Series removed from Sonarr are automatically cleaned from config during startup/drift detection
- **Smart Jellyfin mode detection**: Auto-detects Option 1/2/3 from environment variables - no manual `JELLYFIN_DISABLE_ACTIVE_POLLING` needed
- **Webhook string/integer tag handling**: SeriesAdd webhooks now handle both tag labels (strings) and IDs (integers) via reverse mapping
- **Enhanced documentation**: Dark mode support, reorganized sections (Examples under Rules, FAQ under Troubleshooting), improved navigation

### Changed
- **Delay profile simplification**: Now contains only 3 control tags (default, select, delay) - rule tags no longer added
- **404 error handling**: Series not found (404) logged as DEBUG instead of ERROR - reduces log noise
- **Log clarity improvements**: "already processed (no control tags)" replaces "no episeerr tags" for clearer messaging
- **Grace cleanup loop**: Series marked as `grace_cleaned` only re-enters loop after watch activity

### Fixed
- **Tag removal in webhooks**: Now correctly converts tag labels to IDs before API calls - prevents "tag not found" errors
- **Series safety check**: Always fetches full series object before updates to prevent race conditions
- **Jellyfin polling in Option 1**: Systems with TRIGGER_MIN/MAX and no POLL_INTERVAL no longer run unnecessary polling

### Technical Details
- Tag mapping: Maintains bidirectional label↔ID mapping for webhook compatibility
- Cleanup flags: `grace_cleaned` flag prevents redundant daily checks until next watch event
- 404 handling: Graceful removal from config with summary count in reconciliation logs
- Jellyfin detection: Inspects env vars to determine mode without manual override

### Migration Notes
- **Automatic**: No user action required
- **Sonarr delay profile**: May show extra rule tags briefly - these will be cleaned on next startup
- **Jellyfin Option 1 users**: Polling auto-disables after container restart
- **Documentation updates**: Restart container to see updated UI documentation

[2.9.7] - 2026-01-21
Added

Orphaned tag detection in watch webhooks: Series with episeerr tags but not in config are automatically added when watched

Enables fully tag-based workflow - tag shows in Sonarr, watch episodes, Episeerr picks them up
Complements existing startup/cleanup orphaned detection



Fixed

Case-sensitivity in drift detection: move_series_in_config() now uses case-insensitive rule lookups

Prevents errors when tag case doesn't match config rule case
Completes case-insensitive tag matching from 2.9.6


Jellyfin configuration detection: Moved load_dotenv() before environment variable reads in media_processor

Fixes "Jellyfin not configured" error when env vars are actually set
Ensures active polling starts correctly


Sonarr webhook rule assignment: New series with episeerr tags now use case-insensitive rule matching

Tag episeerr_One_At_A_Time correctly matches rule one_at_a_time



Technical Details

Watch webhooks now perform full tag reconciliation (drift + orphaned detection)
All rule name comparisons system-wide are now case-insensitive
Environment variables load before being accessed in media_processor.py

Migration Notes

Fully automatic - no user action required
Users with Jellyfin will need to restart for configuration fix to take effect

## [2.9.6] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Rule descriptions**: Optional description field for rules to document their purpose
  - Appears as tooltip when hovering over rule name
  - Helps organize and understand multiple rules
- **Orphaned tag detection**: Finds shows with episeerr tags but not in config, adds them automatically
  - Runs on startup
  - Runs during cleanup cycles  
  - Runs when "Clean Config" button clicked
  - Allows tag-based management entirely through Sonarr
- **Enhanced drift detection**: Now runs in multiple locations
  - Detects during watch webhooks (existing)
  - Detects during startup (new)
  - Detects during cleanup cycles (new)
  - Detects during "Clean Config" button (new)

### Changed
- **Case-insensitive tag matching**: Sonarr lowercases all tags internally
  - All tag comparisons now case-insensitive
  - Prevents false drift detection from case differences
  - Rule names can use any case (Get1keepseason vs get1keepseason)

### Fixed
- **False drift detection** from Sonarr's tag lowercasing behavior
- **Case-sensitivity bugs** in drift detection and rule lookups
- **Description field** now saves properly in create/edit rule forms
- **Notification import** errors in webhook processing

### Technical Details
- Comprehensive tag reconciliation runs on startup (create, migrate, drift, orphaned in single pass)
- Orphaned tag detection integrated into cleanup cycles
- All rule name lookups now case-insensitive
- Description field added to rule schema (optional, max 200 chars recommended)

### Migration Notes
- Fully automatic - no user action required
- Rule descriptions will be blank for existing rules (optional field)
- Orphaned shows will be automatically discovered and added to matching rules
- Case variations in rule names will be handled transparently

## [2.9.5] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- **Automatic tag system**: Rule-specific tags (`episeerr_<rulename>`) auto-created in Sonarr
- **Tag migration**: One-time bulk sync applies tags to all existing series on first startup
- **Drift detection**: Auto-corrects when tags manually changed in Sonarr
  - Detects tag changes during watch webhooks (Jellyfin/Tautulli)
  - Moves series to correct rule in config automatically
  - Syncs missing tags back to Sonarr
- **Delay profile integration**: Automatically manages episeerr tags in Sonarr delay profiles
  - Finds existing custom delay profile with episeerr tags
  - Adds/removes rule tags when rules created/deleted
  - Always preserves `episeerr_default` and `episeerr_select` tags

### Changed
- Rule creation/deletion now manages tags automatically in Sonarr and delay profiles
- Tags removed from series and Sonarr when rules deleted

### Fixed
- Config parameter passing in delay profile functions
- Import statements for tag functions across modules

### Technical Details
- Tag functions centralized in `episeerr_utils.py`
- Drift detection in `media_processor.py` webhook processing
- Migration controlled by `tag_migration_complete` flag in config
- Delay profile managed via `delay_profile_migrated` flag

### Migration Notes
- Fully automatic - no user action required
- First startup: creates all rule tags, syncs to series, updates delay profile
- Existing delay profile with episeerr tags will be detected and used
- Tags in Sonarr will match rules in Episeerr config automatically
